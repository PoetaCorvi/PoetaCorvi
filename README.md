## Leo @PoetaCorvi

+ On GitHub to organize information about my Minecraft Modpack, that should hopefully function as a wiki once I release it.

+ Currently I've not made any mods of my own, however I do know bits and pieces of navigating the scene and would like to start a project someday. My modpack Animal Overload
was made because of my interest in animal biology, especially less popular areas such as realistic arthropods, fish, reptiles, and similar. 
However, I still have some specific animals and features I'd like that I've not seen in any mod, so any project will probably be made to fill those gaps I feel in the modpack.

+ I don't have much to offer in regards to technical collaborations with mods and similar, however if any mod projects have use for a concept artist or someone who knows a good
bit about animal biology, I'm absolutely open to offers. Examples of my concept art style can be found ~~_here_~~, my main art account is a very different style. 
>Check back later for concept art archive, still putting it together at the moment!

+ The quickest way to contact me is on Twitter, I also use Instagram but replies may be slower. Both can be found at @PoetaCorvi. Alternatively you can email me at
poetacorvi@gmail.com.
